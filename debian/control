 The Pharo Launcher is a cross-platform application that
   - lets you manage your Pharo images (launch, rename, copy and delete);
   - lets you download image templates (i.e., zip archives) from many
     different sources (Jenkins, files.pharo.org, and your local
     cache);
   - lets you create new images from any template.
 .
 The idea behind the Pharo Launcher is that you should be able to
 access it very rapidly from your OS application launcher. As a
 result, launching any image is never more than 3 clicks away.
